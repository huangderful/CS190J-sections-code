# Section Summary
---
Reviewed Community Detection:
Basic assumptions, hierarchical clustering, modularity, spectral graph theory
#### In class problems:
Challenge the assumptions made of community detection.

Think of other ways to measure modularity.

Pros and cons of the different linkage strategies.

### Textbook problems
[Textbook Link](https://math.bme.hu/~gabor/oktatas/SztoM/Newman_Networks.pdf)
`11.4 (a)`
`11.4 (b)`
`11.5 (b)` (But instead of cosine similarity, use the Ravasz algorithm.)
### Other problems
Construct some graph
1. Circle a community that if partitioned would be strong on your graph.
2. Circle a community that if partitioned would be weak.
3. Is there only 1 way to define a similarity matrix? If not, explain a new method and what the semantics of using an Agglomerative algorithm on this similarity would mean.
4. Explain why the expected connections in graph modularity Pij is defined as kikj/2L.
5. Calculate the Shannon entropy of a community in your graph.
6. Explain what the number of zero eigenvalues mean in the eigvals of the laplacian.
