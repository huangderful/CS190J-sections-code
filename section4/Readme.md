Reviewed Centralities: Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, Eigenvector, HITS, PageRank

Markov Chains

#### In class problems:
Given a graph what is the degree, betweenness, closeness centrality

What problem does HITS have as a website ranking algorithm and how does PageRank solve this issue?

### Textbook problems
[Textbook Link](https://math.bme.hu/~gabor/oktatas/SztoM/Newman_Networks.pdf)
`7.1 (d)`
`7.2`
`7.3`
`7.4 (a)`
`7.4 (b)`


### Other problems
1. Go through the demo and see if you can find the same centrality values as the given graphs for
- Degree centrality
- Closeness centrality
- Betweenness centrality

2. You remove one edge from a network, which centrality measures would be most sensitive to this change and which would not be as perturbed?

3. Consider a k-regular graph (each node in the graph has a degree of k) which centrality measures are the same for all nodes and which are not? (Verify your answer with networkx)
